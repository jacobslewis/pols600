# POL S 600 - Advanced Quantitative Methods

# Introduction
Welcome to POL S 600! This semester, we will build on the methods that were learned in the introductory stats course offered to PPPA graduate students. We should plan to meet about 8 times or so (every other week, approximately), probably on Fridays via Zoom or Slack.

Over the course of the semester, we are going to spend time going over the following quantitative issues, both theoretically and in an applied setting:
1. Really trying to understand data and regressions beyond a coefficient table
2. Understanding the theoretical and applied reason to use maximum likelihood models
3. Understanding standard error clustering and multilevel modeling
4. Providing core skills in data management and visualization

It is my hope that at the end of this semester, students will feel empowered to really begin producing publication-quality research using quantitative methods.
